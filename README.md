# Restaurant Reviews Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing restaurant reviews to determine customer sentimentsâ€”classifying them as positive or negative. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the system aims to assist restaurant owners in understanding customer feedback and improving service quality.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Utilizes a dataset of restaurant reviews.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares text data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Applies machine learning models to categorize reviews.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses model accuracy and effectiveness.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Text Cleaning**: Removes punctuation, numbers, and special characters.
   - **Tokenization**: Splits text into individual words.
   - **Stop Words Removal**: Eliminates common words that do not contribute to sentiment.
   - **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their root forms.

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Represents text data as numerical features.
   - **TF-IDF**: Weighs the importance of words in the corpus.

3. **Modeling**
   - **Training**: Uses algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.
   - **Validation**: Evaluates models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

- **Source**: The dataset is included in the repository as `retauraunt NLP.tsv`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohamedsalama677/Restaurant_Reviews.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Restaurant_Reviews
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   python retauraunt\ NLP.py
   ```

## Applications

- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Helps businesses understand customer satisfaction.
- **Service Improvement**: Identifies areas needing enhancement based on negative reviews.
- **Market Research**: Analyzes trends in customer opinions.

## Limitations & Future Work

- **Challenges**: Handling sarcasm, context, and ambiguous sentiments in text.
- **Future Enhancements**: Incorporating deep learning models and expanding the dataset for better accuracy.
